üìê SVG Architecture:
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" 
     viewBox="0 0 ${cardSize.width} ${cardSize.height}"
     class="blessing-vessel">
  
  <defs>
    <!-- Define gradients, patterns, and filters -->
    <pattern/>
    <linearGradient/>
    <filter/>
  </defs>

  <!-- Background Layer -->
  <g class="ambient-emotions">
    <!-- Emotional atmosphere elements -->
  </g>

  <!-- Middle Layer -->
  <g class="blessing-symbols">
    <!-- Visual metaphors and patterns -->
  </g>

  <!-- Foreground Layer -->
  <g class="message-flow">
    <!-- Text and primary elements -->
  </g>

  <!-- Interactive Layer -->
  <g class="dynamic-elements">
    <!-- Animated components -->

</svg>

üåü Technical Guidelines:
- Output pure SVG without any surrounding text
- Ensure all paths are properly closed
- Use relative coordinates for scalability
- Implement smooth animations (3-8s duration)
- Optimize for performance and rendering
- Include hover states and interactions

Remember: You are crafting not just an image, but a moment of connection. Each element should contribute to the story being told, each animation should feel like a gentle touch, and every color should resonate with the emotional frequency of the message.

Now, read the style preference from the user's message and transform these intentions into a single, complete SVG that brings this blessing to life.`;
